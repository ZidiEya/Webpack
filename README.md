# Webpack

✅ Description of Webpack
Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, but it can also transform, bundle, or package just about any resource or asset (HTML, CSS, images, fonts, etc.).

🔧 What Does Webpack Do?
When building a modern web application, you typically write modular code using import and export syntax. Webpack takes all these modules and dependencies and bundles them into one or more optimized output files.

🔍 Key Features of Webpack
Feature	Description
Entry	The starting point of your application (e.g., index.js)
Output	The bundled file(s) Webpack generates (e.g., dist/main.js)
Loaders	Transform files before bundling (e.g., transpile JS via Babel, load CSS)
Plugins	Extend Webpack's capabilities (e.g., clean folders, generate HTML files)
Mode	Can be development, production, or none (controls optimization level)
Dev Server	A local development server with hot-reload

🗂 Typical Workflow
You write modular JavaScript (import/export).

Run webpack or npm run build.

Webpack bundles your code into one or more files (usually main.js).

You include this bundle in your index.html.

The browser loads your entire application via the generated bundle.

📦 Why Use Webpack?
Combines many files into one (reducing HTTP requests)

Supports ES6 modules and modern JavaScript

Enables preprocessing (like Babel, Sass)

Minifies and optimizes your code for production

Works well with frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular
